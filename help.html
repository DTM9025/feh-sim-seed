    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
    Choose a goal from the dropdown menu. The options are:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Any 5*</strong> - take every orb that has a focus unit in that color, and continue until any focus or non-focus 5* unit appears.</li>
        <li><strong>Any focus</strong> - take every orb that has a focus unit in that color, and continue until any focus 5* unit appears.</li>
        <li><strong>Red/blue/green/colorless focus</strong> - choose one of the focus units in that color. Take every orb of that color and continue until that focus unit appears, ignoring other 5*s and other focus units, even ones sharing the same color.</li>
    </ul>
    The <em>count</em> option makes it simulate until the chosen goal has been reached multiple times, for answering questions like "can I get my +4 to +10 on this banner?"
    <h3>Banner selection</h3>
    Select the starting rates from the dropdown menu.
    <br />
    Enter the number of focus units that the banner has on each color in the R/B/G/C boxes.
    <h2>Results</h2>
    The graph shows how many orbs you need to spend to get a certain percent chance of reaching your goal, with labels at a few milestones for hard numbers. Each label shows the number of orbs spent before the indicated percentage of simulated results reach the goal.
    <br />
    Don't forget that there is no amount of spending that can guarantee that you reach the goal. The 99th percentile shows a really high cost, but one out of every hundred people who read this will spend more than that next time they go to summon.
    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h4>How do split focuses work here?</h4>
    Let's take the first Legendary Banner as an example. You want Fjorm, but don't care about Xander or Caeda as the other two blue options. If you select <em>blue focus</em> as your goal, then the result will be how much you need to spend to get that Fjorm, no matter how many Xanders or Caedas you get along the way.
    <br />
    In a future update, there will be an <em>advanced</em> goal selection that will let you set more complicated goals like "get either this focus unit or this other one", or "get at least one of every focus unit".
