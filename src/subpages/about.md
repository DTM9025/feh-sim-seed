### Assumptions About Soft Pity Mechanics

Due to the fact that the exact mechanics of soft pity, and the gacha system in general, are unknown, there are
certain assumption that had to be made when building this statistic simulator.

The model used is based on the statistics given in this post:

### Note on Epitomized Path

Note that currently, the Epitomized Path mechanic for Weapon Banners has not been implemented yet. This
mechanic will hopefully be included in this simulator in the near future.
