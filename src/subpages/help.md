## Settings

### Goal

Choose a goal from the dropdown menu. The options are:

* **Custom goal** - details below.
* **Any 5\* focus unit** - take every orb that has a focus unit, and continue until any focus unit appears.
* **All 5\* focus units** - take every orb that has a focus unit that hasn't been acquired yet, and continue until they have all appeared.
* **Specific \<color\> 5\* focus unit** - take every orb of that color, and continue until a certain one of that color's focus units appears, ignoring any others that share that color. When the *count* is above 1, the unit will need to appear multiple times.
* **Any \<color\> 5\* focus unit** - take every orb of that color, and continue until any of the focus units from that color appears.
* **The \<color\> 4\* focus unit** - take every orb of the 4\* focus color until the requested number of 5\* or 4\* copies of the 4\* focus unit have appeared.

#### Custom goals

For examples of how they work, you can choose a preset and then switch to a custom goal to see what that preset is actually doing. Each goal is a collection of individual unit targets. The simulator will continue until one of those targets appears or until all of those targets have appeared, depending on the all vs. any setting. When there are multiple targets for the same color, they each represent a different focus unit.

For example, if you want a +10 of the new legendary hero and also to pick up one copy of another unit on a different color, set the selector to "All of these" instead of "Any of these" and create two entries: 11 copies of a specific \<legendary color\> unit, and 1 copy of a specific \<other color\> unit. The simulation will then pull every orb that is either one of those colors until either that other unit has appeared or the legendary unit has appeared 11 times, and then continues on just one color until the other goal happens too.

Custom goals do not currently work with 4\* focus units.

### Banner selection

Select the starting rates from the dropdown menu.

Enter the number of focus units that the banner has on each color in the R/B/G/C boxes.

If this banner allows you to earn focus charges, check the "Focus charge?" box.

If this banner has a 4* focus, enter the color in the 4\* focus selection box. There is currently no way to simulate banners with multiple 4\* focus units.

## Results

The graph shows how many orbs you need to spend to get a certain percent chance of reaching your goal, with labels at a few milestones for hard numbers. Each label shows the number of orbs spent before the indicated percentage of simulated results reach the goal.

Clicking or tapping on the graph will place a label on the line at the chosen horizontal position. Click "run" again to restore the standard labels.

Don't forget that there is no amount of spending that can guarantee that you reach the goal. The 99th percentile shows a really high cost, but one out of every hundred people who read this will spend more than that next time they go to summon.
